            <p>
                I am a senior software engineer with 5+ years of experience writing production-quality code.
                Nearly all of those years have been spent working on various Cloud data and infrastructure engineering projects.
                I like working on projects that solve a problem, deliver real client value, and challenge me.<br><br><br>
                In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, fly fishing, playing my mandolin, and going to see live music.
                I am  happiest when spending time with friends, family, and my wife - preferably outdoors!

            <p>
              In the design and testing of the code that I write, I am thoroughly thorough. I always consider how things will be used in the future and not just by me but by others as well. Style and maintainability are absolutely paramount, and if code is not readable and maintainable, then it cannot be said to satisfy its requirements. The codebases that make up the web of modern technology are a scrambled mess of duplication, spaghetti code, and non-intuitive, undocumented one-liners. All engineers’ lives would be easier if code was written and maintained better and I try to do my part to ease the load. <br><br>

              I like being part of a team that is working on important and interesting things. I like being able to look at a piece of software and generally understand how it was created. I think it is important that programmers never lose the sense of adventure, curiousity, and creativity that was pervasive in those that did this job/hobby before us. When ingenuity and technical know-how come together, code can look just as much like a piece of art as it can a discrete piece of engineering. For a programmer, there is nothing more satisfying. Keep Programming (the right way)! It’s fun! I know I will.
