            <p>
                I am a senior software engineer with 5+ years of experience writing production-quality code.
                Nearly all of those years have been spent working on various Cloud data and infrastructure engineering projects.
                I like working on projects that solve a problem, deliver real client value, and challenge me.<br><br><br>
                In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, fly fishing, playing my mandolin, and going to see live music.
                I am  happiest when spending time with friends, family, and my wife - preferably outdoors!
