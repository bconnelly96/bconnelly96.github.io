                I am a senior software engineer with 5+ years of experience writing production-quality code.
                Nearly all of those years have been spent working on various Cloud data and infrastructure engineering projects.
                I like working on projects that solve a problem, deliver real client value, and challenge me.<br><br><br>
                In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, fly fishing, playing my mandolin, and going to see live music.
                I am  happiest when spending time with friends, family, and my wife - preferably outdoors!

              I am a “classically-trained” backend software engineer. What does this mean? I’m not exactly sure but I made it up and thought it had a nice ring to it. I am as comfortable behind a terminal as I am writing code in a fancy souped-up editor with AI-suggestion and built-in version control. I like dealing with data. I can write dirty little scripts that get the job done and well-thought out code that satisfies a requested architecture. I like being able to look at a piece of software or technology and generally understand how it was created.<br><br>

              In the design and testing of the code that I write, I am thoroughly thorough. I always consider how things will be used in the future and not just by me but by others as well. That translates to how I write the code as well. Style and maintainability are absolutely paramount, and if code is not readable and maintainable, then it cannot be said to satisfy its requirements. The codebases that make up the web of modern technology are a scrambled mess of duplication, spaghetti code, and non-intuitive, undocumented one-liners. All engineers’ lives would be easier if code was written and maintained better and I try to do my part to ease the load. But when code is written, the job is not done. Even if a solution “works”, it is important to consider if it can be improved.
